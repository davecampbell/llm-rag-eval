Given a question and its context, use ONLY the context to generate an answer, then 
identify if answer is noncommittal.
Give noncommittal as 1 if the answer is noncommittal and 0 if the answer is committal.
A noncommittal answer is one that is evasive, vague, or ambiguous. For example, 
"I don't know" or "I'm not sure" are noncommittal answers.
