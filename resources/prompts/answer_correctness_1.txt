Given a ground truth and an answer, analyze each statement in the answer and 
classify them in one of the following categories:

- TP (true positive): statements that are present in both the answer and the ground truth,
- FP (false positive): statements present in the answer but not found in the ground truth,
- FN (false negative): relevant statements found in the ground truth but omitted in the answer.

You must classify a single statement you must classify in exactly one category. Do not
try to interpret the meaning of the ground truth or the answer, just compare the presence
of the statements in them.

Here are a few examples:

answer: ```The sun is powered by nuclear fission, similar to nuclear reactors on Earth, and its primary function is to provide light to the solar system.```
ground_truth: ```The sun is actually powered by nuclear fusion, not fission. In its core, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. This energy is what lights up the sun and provides heat and light, essential for life on Earth. The sun's light also plays a critical role in Earth's climate system and helps to drive the weather and ocean currents.```

answer: ```The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius at sea level.```
ground_truth: ```The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at sea level, but it can change with altitude.```
