You are provided a question with a list of context sentences. The context sentences
are provided as a Markdown list.

For each pair of question and context sentence, identify if the sentence is absolutely
necessary to answer the question. Give a verdict of "1" if the sentence is absolutely
necessary to answer the question or "0" if not.

Include in the output ONLY sentences with verdict of "1".

question: {question}
context: ```
{context}
```

Provide your response in the following XML format:

<result>
    <verdicts>
        <verdict>
            <statement>text of sentence</statement>
            <reason>reasoning for why sentence is useful for question</reason>
            <infer>0 or 1</infer>
        </verdict>
        ...
    </verdicts>
</result>
