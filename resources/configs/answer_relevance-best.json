        "answer": "Everyone has the right to be fully informed about human rights violations, including the identities of the perpetrators and the fate of the victims. This right is recognized by various international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nThe victims of human rights violations and their families have a particular right to know the truth about what happened to them. This includes knowing the identities of the perpetrators and the fate of the victims, such as whether they are alive or dead, and if dead, the circumstances of their death.\n\nFurthermore, society as a whole has a right to be informed about human rights violations. This is essential for holding perpetrators accountable, preventing future abuses, and ensuring justice and reparations for the victims. Access to information about human rights violations also allows for public scrutiny and debate, which are crucial for building a culture of human rights and promoting transparency and accountability.\n\nJournalists, human rights defenders, and civil society organizations play a vital role in investigating and reporting on human rights violations. They have the right to access information, conduct independent investigations, and disseminate their findings to the public. Governments have a responsibility to protect and facilitate these activities, ensuring that individuals and organizations can operate freely and without fear of reprisals.\n\nIn summary, the right to be fully informed about human rights violations, including the identities of the perpetrators and the fate of the victims, belongs to everyone. It is a fundamental aspect of promoting human rights, accountability, and justice.",

        "answer": "The purpose of the agreement known as 30x30 is to conserve and protect 30% of the planet's land and oceans by the year 2030. This agreement aims to address the global biodiversity crisis and the impacts of climate change by preserving and restoring ecosystems, promoting sustainable land and ocean management practices, and safeguarding the habitats of numerous plant and animal species. The goal is to ensure the long-term health and resilience of the planet's natural resources and to support the well-being of both human and non-human communities.",
        "context": "1. These include the agreement known as 30x30, adopted at the UN Conference on Biological Diversity (COP15) held in Montreal, Canada, in late 2022, which commits Parties to designate 30% of the world's land and sea masses as protected areas for biodiversity conservation by 2030.\n2. Protecting and restoring these ecosystems is one of the most efficient, equitable and cost-effective mechanisms to capture and store carbon without compromising human rights.\n3. However, the focus of the agreement should not be limited to the amount of area it covers, but rather to how it is managed, who selects the areas, and what biodiversity exists in them.\n4. Indigenous Peoples and local communities have a key role to play here.\n5. Unfortunately, at COP15, States failed to explicitly recognize Indigenous Peoples' lands and territories as a distinct category of protected area, and this threatens their rights.",
